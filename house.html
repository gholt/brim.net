                <div>I figured I'd post up some photos of the house that aren't photoshopped to look overly glamorous.</div>
                <div><br />First, here's the house from the street.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="01FromStreet.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />Then, the view of the street from the front of the side yard. There are almost always other people's cars parked in front; big city living.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="02SideYardTowardStreet.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />Here's the larger side yard, the other one is just wide enough to have a paved walkway around to the back.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="03OtherSideYard.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />This the patio, it had a fire pit and chairs and such in the glamour shots. It really is pretty nice. The planters are fairly substantial concrete boxes. The whole yard has a crazy sprinkler system; something I didn't think would be needed in Seattle.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="04PatioCircle.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />The back deck to the back door. Not pictured is a remote controlled awning that moves out to cover the whole deck. I'd found a remote inside and was punching buttons to figure out what it was for when I heard a motor outside.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="05DeckBackDoor.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />Decent garage, especially for Seattle. One car plus extra room back and to the side. This garage can only be accessed via the alleyway along the back of the property.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="06OnePlusGarage.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />And this is that alleyway. Neighbors say it's usually not so bad, but there's construction going on and the trucks have really roughed it up. Honestly, Seattle's meant more for SUVs and trucks anyway; the roads are pretty bad here due to all the moisture.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="07Alleyway.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />Yay? A chicken coop? No, I don't plan on raising chickens. The roof is kind of neat; they deliberately made it into a planter with proper drainage and all.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="08ChickenCoop.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />This is fun. Three trash cans. Biggest one is for anything compostable, next one is for recycling, and the tiny tiny one is for, you guessed it, trash.</div>
                <div><img width="49%" src="09ThreeTrashCans.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />This is the view from just inside the front door. Living room / tv room closest, fades into the dining area, to the kitchen and out the back door to the deck. Ignore my lone lamp; it's on a timer to somewhat randomly turn on and off to look like someone lives here while I'm gone.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="10JustInsideFrontDoor.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />Here's looking forward from the kitchen. The blinds are those kind that pull up or down or a bit of both depending on what you want. That door to the right up toward the front door is to the office, the next door is to the bedroom.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="11JustInFrontOfKitchenTowardsFrontDoor.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />The kitchen. Really nice appliances, way more cabinet space than I need, and two lazy susans in the corners. Stove is city gas, as is the heating for air and water.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="12Kitchen.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />The fridge hides over here along with a broom closet and the back door. That blank wall space houses the washer and dryer in the bathroom on the other side of the wall.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="13KitchenTowardBackDoor.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />Here's the office, at the front of the house off the living room. You "might" be able to put a bed in here, but there's no closet and it'd be really tight anyway. It's an office.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="14Office.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />This is an oddity. Not the attic access door but the weird shelf up there in the back of the office. That's space that is above the closets in the bedroom on the other side of the wall. Seems like a good place to stash boxes and such though.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="15WeirdShelfInOffice.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />And here's the bedroom, as seen from the door coming from the dining area. You can see just one closet in the photo, but that whole wall is closet. That fan has this fancy remote control.</div>
                <div><img width="100%" src="16MasterBedroom.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />The bathroom feels pretty roomy, especially for such a tiny house. The stackable washer and dryer are in here, as I mentioned before. There are doors from the bedroom and the kitchen.</div>
                <div><img width="49%" src="17Bathroom.jpg" /> <img width="49%" src="18WasherDryer.jpg" /></div>
                <div><br />And that's the tour!</div>
